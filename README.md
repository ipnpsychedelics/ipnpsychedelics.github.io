# Intercollegiate Psychedelics Network (IPN)

The Intercollegiate Psychedelics Network (IPN) is a student run umbrella organization that supports collegiate psychedelic student groups and intercollegiate efforts. We strive to support collaboration among college students and envision an academic community that inspires a philosophically motivated and scientifically rigorous study of psychedelics, and more broadly, consciousness; we hope through our work to encourage public awareness of the science, policy, and clinical applications of psychedelics and related substances.

IPN is distributed, non-hiearchical, non-domineering, non-dogmatic; we are connected by foundational principles of radical transparency, mindful presence, iterative growth, commitment to ethics, and boundless love; we do not know all the answers and do not assume our current approach is the "one true approach"; we strive to adapt and integrate opinions of the public, experts, collegiate institutions, and grow together in the true spirit of co-creation; we are always open to ideas, suggestions, and criticisms; we believe if we are thoughtful and proceed with cautious optimisim, we can co-create together a more connected and blissful future~

#### The Intercollegiate Psychedelics Network strives to:
- support member organizations however member organizations define support
- foster meaningful relationships based on the principles of respect, education, compassion, spiritual growth, emotional wellness, and psychological intimacy with oneself
- encourage a more nuanced public discourse about the science of psychedelics
- establish rigorous research trials at member universities
- further drug decriminalization efforts in service of furthering responsible psychedelics research
- cultivate mentorship between and amongst students and professiona

# Code of Ethics
- IPN does not facilitate the creation, distribution, or ingestion of psychedelic substances where it is unlawful
- The top for IPN is is to foster collaboration among students and researchers for the advancement of psychedelic science
- We respect the right of each member to make their own decisions about psychedelics use
- We will advocate that, if students do partake in psychedelics ingestion, that it is done under empirically-optimal conditions and where it is lawful
- We strive to bring students together and create a transparent culture around psychedelics and their effects on our lives
- We will recognize the negative effects of psychedelics use and causes for such negative effects
- IPN recognizes the depth to which we are all equal, and does not discriminate based on ability, orientation, experience, race, culture, age, or any other demographic variable

n.b.: the placement of our code of ethics on the bottom of the page is deliberate; we hope to convey that they are foundational to our existence, and support from the bottom up, deeply, our approach;
